# newspack-rss-enhancements

This plugin adds a new RSS Feeds section to WP Admin. Within that section, you can create and manage customized RSS feeds for syndication partners.

The feed content can be customized in the following ways:
- Number of posts displayed.
- Use full content or post excerpt.
- Include or exclude posts that have specific categories.

To match the RSS specifications for different syndication partners, feed markup can be customized in the following ways:
- Add `<image>` tags to RSS items.
- Add `<media:>` tags to RSS items.
- Add `<updated>` tags with post updated time to RSS items.

Further markup customizations are planned.
